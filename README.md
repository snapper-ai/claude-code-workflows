# Claude Code Workflows

A curated, evolving collection of **Claude Code workflows, subagents, slash commands, and configuration patterns** — designed to help you get better results faster with Claude Code.

This repo focuses on **practical, real-world setups**, inspired by how Claude Code is actually used in production, not just toy examples.

## What you'll find here

- ✅ Example **subagents** (verification, simplification, validation, etc.)
- ✅ Reusable **slash commands** for common inner-loop workflows
- ✅ Opinionated **CLAUDE.md patterns**
- ✅ Safe permission setups and hooks
- ✅ Workflow examples you can fork and adapt

Everything here is meant to be:
- Easy to understand
- Easy to fork
- Easy to extend

## Philosophy

Claude Code works best when:
- It has clear, repeatable workflows
- Verification is built into the loop
- Common tasks are automated, not re-prompted

This repo is about **encoding those habits into the tooling itself**.

## Status

This repository will continue to grow over time as new patterns, agents, and workflows are added.
